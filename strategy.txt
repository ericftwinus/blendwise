BlendWise Nutrition – Comprehensive
Business Plan
1. Executive Summary
BlendWise is a digital health platform designed to empower individuals who rely on tube
feedings by helping them safely prepare homemade blenderized tube feedings (BTF) at home.
Through expert guidance from highly qualified Registered Dietitians, automated planning tools,
and optional grocery delivery, BlendWise restores autonomy, dignity, and control to tube‑fed
individuals who want more natural, personalized nutrition.
Founded by a Registered Dietitian with 15 years of clinical experience and specialty
certifications in nutrition support and oncology nutrition, BlendWise Nutrition fills a major gap in
the healthcare system: most clinicians lack training in homemade BTF, leaving patients without
safe, structured guidance. BlendWise Nutrition provides that expertise through a clinically
supervised, user‑friendly, and emotionally supportive platform.
BlendWise integrates insurance‑billable Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), subscription‑based
automation tools, and future partnership opportunities with equipment and food‑storage
companies. It is the first platform to combine RD oversight, personalized BTF planning,
automated grocery lists, GI‑symptom‑responsive adjustments, and family‑integrated meal
planning.

2. Mission Statement
BlendWise empowers individuals who rely on tube feedings to safely prepare their own
homemade blenderized tube feedings — restoring autonomy, dignity, and control over their
nutrition. Through expert guidance from highly qualified dietitians and a supportive digital
platform, BlendWise helps users confidently choose the feeding approach that best fits their
needs, whether fully homemade, partially blended, or supplemental.

3. Company Description
BlendWise is a digital health company focused on transforming the tube‑feeding experience.
The platform provides personalized RD assessments, customized nutrient targets, automated
grocery lists, recipe generation, symptom‑responsive adjustments, and optional grocery
delivery.

BlendWise is built on evidence‑based practice, clinical expertise, and a deep understanding of
the emotional and practical challenges faced by tube‑fed individuals and their families.
Core Values
● Autonomy
● Safety
● Evidence‑based care
● Accessibility
● Dignity
● Innovation
● Community

4. Problem Statement
Many individuals who rely on tube feeding experience:
● GI intolerance to commercial formulas
● Limited formula variety
● Desire for whole‑food nutrition
● Lack of structured guidance for homemade BTF
● Fear of tube clogging or unsafe blends
● Overwhelm with meal planning and grocery shopping
● Emotional isolation during mealtimes
A major barrier is that many Registered Dietitians, physicians, and other healthcare
providers lack training or confidence in BTF. This leads to:
● Unsafe or nutritionally inadequate blends
● Poor symptom management
● No structured transition plans
● Missed opportunities for improved tolerance and quality of life
BlendWise fills this gap by providing access to experts in BTF, including a founder with 15
years of experience as a Registered Dietitian, a certification in nutrition support, and specialized
knowledge in enteral nutrition.

5. Solution: BlendWise Workflow
Step 1: Initial RD Assessment (Required)

A comprehensive evaluation determines:
● Appropriateness for BTF
● Medical history
● GI symptoms
● Allergies/intolerances
● Dietary preferences
● Feeding regimen
● Equipment access
● Safety considerations
Payment options:
● Insurance‑billable MNT
● Out‑of‑pocket payment
BlendWise may also integrate a nurse practitioner for medical oversight and referrals.
Step 2: RD‑Generated Estimated Nutrient Needs (ENN)
Users receive personalized nutrient targets:
● Calories
● Protein
● Carbohydrate
● Fat
● Fluids
● Fiber
● Micronutrients
● Feeding schedule
● Safety notes
This becomes the foundation for recipe and grocery list generation.
Step 3: User Decision Point
After receiving their RD assessment, users choose whether they want to:
● Fully transition to homemade BTF
● Use a hybrid approach (commercial formula + BTF)
● Supplement their current regimen with BTF occasionally
BlendWise supports all three pathways.

Step 4: Automated Weekly Grocery List
Generated based on:
● ENN
● Allergies
● Dietary preferences
● GI symptoms (e.g., diarrhea → more soluble fiber foods)
● Feeding volume limits
Users can modify ingredients and save favorites.
Step 5: Optional Grocery Delivery
Partnerships with:
● Instacart
● Amazon Fresh
● Walmart
One‑click ordering makes BTF accessible and convenient.
Step 6: RD Follow‑Ups
● 1‑week follow‑up to assess tolerance
● Monthly follow‑ups thereafter
● Additional messaging depending on subscription tier
Insurance or out‑of‑pocket payment applies.
Step 7: Weight &amp; Symptom Tracking
The app tracks:
● Weight trends
● GI symptoms
● Intake consistency
● Recipe tolerance
This data helps RDs adjust plans safely and quickly.
